-signal_domain: Time or frequency (Fast fourier transform)

-signal_subtype: indicates is a Jerk signal transform was used for the value

-axis: Axis movement that is being meaures or total magnitude of the movement

-AverageOfMeans: Average of the mean signal measured for a subject and activity when grouping by all measured variables. 

-AverageOfStd: Average of the standard deviation of the signal measured for a subject and activity when grouping by all measured variables.
